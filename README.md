My plan for this assignment is to create an automatic generating terain the camera will travel through as the music plays and reacts to it as the song progreesses. This will be a two feature project the first is getting the terrain to auto create and dissapear once out of view to reduce rendering on the system and project to increase efficiency. The second feature of music fluxing the terrain or objects in the project will be the harder as it may interfere with the terrain. I took inspiartion from two different vidoes; the first being from the old playstation 3 audio visualizer forming a terrain and travelling it. The second is the pulsating items or objects to the beat or RBM of the song being played.
